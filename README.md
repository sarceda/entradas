# StadiView

**Experience every seat before match day.**

> [!TIP]
> **Teatro Colón — Plano de Sala 3D**: this repo also includes [`teatro-colon.html`](teatro-colon.html),
> a procedural 3D visualization of the main hall of the Teatro Colón (Buenos Aires) built on the same
> seat-preview idea. It models the horseshoe hall at real scale (29.25 m × 32.65 m × 28 m, 7 levels),
> maps every section from the official seating plan (Platea, Palcos, Cazuela, Tertulia, Galería,
> Paraíso and standing room), and lets you click any seat to preview its actual view of the stage —
> including a geometric "% of stage visible" computed by raycasting against parapets, overhangs and
> the proscenium. Run `npm run dev` and open `/teatro-colon.html`.

StadiView is an interactive, procedural 3D football stadium concept. Explore the stadium, select from thousands of generated seats, and fly into a first person preview of the view from each one.

> [!NOTE]
> StadiView is a concept demo. The fixture, prices, seat availability, checkout, and other ticketing data are simulated; no real tickets are sold through this project.

## Highlights

- A fully procedural stadium with no imported 3D models
- Thousands of individually selectable seats rendered efficiently with instancing
- Animated camera flights and first person seat views
- Generated seat previews, pricing, availability, tiers, blocks, and benefits
- Animated players, ball, crowd, lighting, scoreboards, and pitch side displays
- Stadium overview, mini map, orbit controls, keyboard support, and reduced motion handling
- A self contained experience in `index.html`, powered by Three.js and GSAP
